SautÃ© garlic ginger onions, add spices and toast a bit more until fragrant but before it gets burnt
Add lentils and broth and salt.

Simmer for as long as it takes to get lentils tender. Add more water as it gets absorbed and stir it around a bit to avoid lentils burning at the bottom (happens to the best of us, especially if you are monitoring strike comms ðŸ˜…).

Add assorted veg, adjust salt if needed. I added some porcini powder or more bouillon for extra umami but totally optional.

Serve with a squeeze of lemon or whatever fancy drizzles you have (like garlic oil!).
